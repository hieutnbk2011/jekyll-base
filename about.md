    <td><p>I am very interested in the Customer Support Industry. I believe my training, experience, and proven ability as a Senior Technical Support Specialist and Help Desk Technician will allow me to significantly contribute to the productivity and quality of any company's IT division.</p>
<p>You should note that I have acquired valuable experience in all facets of troubleshooting, installations, and maintenance for various desktop operations, hardware, and software. I possess a unique talent for translating highly complex technical information into terms and concepts that the end users can readily grasp. These skills have enabled me, in my most recent position, to reduce our response time to trouble tickets by 45%, vastly improving our client satisfaction ratios.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am multi-task oriented, enjoy a challenge, and continually stay abreast of the latest advancements in the IT field.</p>
<p>If you are seeking an IT professional who has excellent people and problem-solving skills and who can easily provide optimum support to your customer, then please consider what I have to offer.</p>
<p>I believe through the trial weeks, you can understand my abilities well. Till now, I had been a senior Technical Support Representative for HPE (out-sourcing). With the enthusiastic and thoughtful treatment for customer, I have made sure they completely satisfied with their enquiry.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m availableto work anytime, kindly schedule the time as you want.</p>
