      <h2 style="font-weight:bold;"> Question 2: What is your favorite thing about providing technical support? </h2>
      <p> My most favorite thing about providing technical support is solving the hard problem and learn new things. When I worked as L1 Support with HPE customer, I have spent nights to learning new knowledges to troubleshooting and solving customer issues. It's every addicted and I have learnt a huge amount of knowledges about linux,python,scripting in such a short time. Customer's happy when I can help them solve their issue, while other L3 engineers ignored it. The hard working and thoughtful treatment helped me to promoted to L2 within a year, and I received the company award for that effort. </p> 
   <p> Solving hard issues makes me happy! </p>

       <h2 style="font-weight:bold;"> Question 3: What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  </h2>
      <p> Your service is good for education. Most student will find it helpful to deploy their code to the website in an instant of time, and there is a lot of available tools, which will help them to learn a lot of new technologys. Honestly I used the free plan only, so I'm not sure if there is any other bad side which I haven't touch. </p>
      <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Question 4: Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.</h2>
      <p> Actually I know most about HTML tags, so I 've choosen Jekyll because it have only simple pages and I can edit and put all answers on it. After deploy the code to netlify and git hub, I searched and found the index page and edit it with my HTML knowledge. In the future, I will try my best to learn all frameworks. It's not only my duty, but I also want to learn new things.</p>
      <p> I don't see any real challenge when make the site, since Jekyll's easy to understand, and netlify having build logs when deploy the code to website. </p>
      <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Question 5: Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?</h2>
      <p> I have no concern with the job posting. With the test, I want to see some real problems to solve (fix a site), rather than build a site and put answers on it. </p>
      <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Question 6: Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.</h2>
      <p>Link: http://success.mixmax.com/article/62-add-send-as-addresses-and-aliases </p>
      <p>This successcenter provide FAQ and documentation for user, and it's well done. The guides is distributed to seperated topics, and each guide have clear, detailed information with steps and even tutorial video.</p>
      <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Question 7: Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?</h2>
       <p>SSL/HTTPS is important, because it's more secure. With SSL, sensitive information was encrypted, unreadable to everyone except for the server you are sending the information to. This protects it from hackers and identity thieves. </p> 
       <p>SSL also provides Trust. A website using SSL/HTTPS with a CA signed, will be reliable, and you can feel comfortable to input your credit card infomation on it.</p>
       <p>The latest version of SSL Protocol is 1.2, and I'm sure that a lot of customer will request to apply it, to make sure their website is compliance with any security scan.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight:bold;">Question 8: Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users </h2>
        <p> I will assume that you are mentioning configuring of DNS records. Not sure if they are really challenges but I will focus on 2 basic issues that less-technical customer can meet: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> It's hard to find clear, detailed documentation about DNS configuration over the internet. They did exist, but they will be mixed with other complex documentation, or the ones about DNS Server Configuration for Windows which are not related but more popular in google search. A person with little technical knowledge will spend a lot of time to find the correct documentation. </li>
          <li> There are a variety of DNS Record types to fill when customer configure DNS: A, MX, CName,AAA... They will be confused and can input the wrong information or create a wrong DNS records. </li>
        </ul>
       <h2 style="font-weight:bold;"> Question 9: A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be useful in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.</h2>
      <p> Thanks for contacting Netlify Support Team and share with us your current experience. We accept full responsibility for the mistake and we assure you we are taking the necessary steps to prevent it from happening in the future. </p>
      <p> Can you kindly provide deploy log when you published code to the site.We'll have our development team to check on that, and will keep you updated until we complete resolve the issue. Again,Sorry for the inconvenience - we'll get it fixed ASAP.</p>
        <h2 style="font-weight:bold;"> (optional/bonus) Can you set up a redirect from “/netlify/anything” to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything ? </h2>
      <p> Done! Please check. <p>
